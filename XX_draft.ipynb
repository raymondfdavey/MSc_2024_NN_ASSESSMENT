These approaches, by encoporating properties such as the 'momentum' of the gradient, as well as adaptive learning rates have been shown to allow for a smoother and more direct journey through paramater space to the miminimum loss. However, one of the objective was to explore the effect of the learning rate on performance, and with SGD the paramaters are directly updated the parameters based only on the gradient and the learning rate. By keeping to this very direct forumlation it easier to understand and interpret the impact of the learning rate on the model's performance - the learning rate has a clear and direct influence on the step size of the parameter updates, making it straightforward to study its effect. SGD is highly sensitive to the choice of the learning rate and this sensitivity is precisely what makes SGD suitable for studying the impact of learning rate on model performance. By varying the learning rate and observing the corresponding changes in model behavior, you can gain insights into the optimal learning rate range and its effect on convergence speed and generalization. The absence of adaptive learning rates in SGD in particular  ensures that the learning rate remains consistent throughout the training process.\n",
