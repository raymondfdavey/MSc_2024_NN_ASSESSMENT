        "The labelled CIFAR-10 dataset and it's larger sibling CIFAR-100 have been used for benchmarking and testing in many exploratory and ground breaking papers relating to computer vision and image classification, not least in the development of Alexnet [8], Resnet [4] and most recently transformer-for vision architectures [3]. It is fitting, then, to use it to explore some of the fundamental properties of aritificial neural networks (NN) in this assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first experiment examined the effect that altering the learning rate (LR) has on training and performance. As well as experimenting with different learning rates, a LR 'scheduler' was designed and its effect on performance analysed through comparison to models with static learning rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second experiment aimed to demonstrate and offer insight into the impact of introducing a dropout layer into the arhchitecture of the network. Different dropout rates were trialled and their effects compared to baseline performance during both training and evaluation. The effect of dropout was also tested in a transfer learning context.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third experiment focused on analysing gradient flow during back propagation in different architectures. Gradients were measured and plotted in all layers during training in the baseline model, a model with dropout, and a model with batch normalisation, with results compared to gain insight. The performance of the model training with batch normalisation was also compared to that of the other models.\n",

        "For this experiment a new model implimenting batch normalisation was defined using the inbuilt Python `nn.BatchNorm`. This impliments a process by which the activations of a layer are normalised by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation. After normalisation, the activations are scaled and shifted using learnable parameters (`bn.weight` and `bn.bias` in Fig 23.). It has been shown to enable faster learning rates and to have a regularising effect among other benefits [1], [6]. It was applied to all except for the last layer here. \n",

This shows that models trained with higher LRs are able to fit to the training data more quickly, but also overfit to it more quickly.

The LR scheduled model's validation accuracy stabalises in a way that did not occur with any of the  the other models that saturated at close to 100% training accuracy before.

This is again likely owing to (in the case of high LR models) being too coarse to hone in on a particular point in paramater space that would give it 100% accuracy, or (in the case of the very low learning rates) possibly being unable to tranverse the loss landscape effectively owing to too small a gradient, possibly getting stuck in sub-optimal minima.  \n",

All models were initialised with the same paramaters other than the dopout rate and what can be observed demonstrates the effect of dropout as a regularisation technique - as the dropout rate increases from 0 to 0.8 we see a reduction in the speed and extent to which the model fits to the training data. This is reflected in the final accuracy it obtains on the training data and the speed with which is gets there. It can also be seen in the significant decrease in the the generalisation gap between training and validation performance, where in the absence of dropout (9.1) there is the biggest gap. and the highest dropout leads to the smallest gap.\n",

Looking at the validation loss, one can see the onset and of that loss is earlier and it is developmeny more severe for the lower dropout rates. Despite this, accuracy is relatively well preserved as the lower dropout rates still  atttain reasonable performance on both test and validation datasets. That being said, the best test loss and test performance belongs to those models with higher dropout rates, albeit by a small margin.\n",

However, what it does learn is mostly generalised to the validation dataset. These findings are also visable in the comparison plot in Fig 13. \n",

Firstly, all of the bias terms for convolutional layers that have had with batch normalisation applied simply dissapear. This is because as the role of the bias paramater is essentially taken over by the parameters of the batch normalisation layer (as seen in Fig 23.) due to the 'absorbtion of bias' phenomenon in batch normalisation [x, y].\n",

        "These experiments demonstrated some of the fundamental properties of aritficial nueral networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Experiment one demonstrated the effect that the learning can have on a models ability to fit to training data, and the impact that this has on generalisation. It showed that too high a LR could lead to coarse updates that lead to instability and variability in performance and and in ability to get to the true optimal minimial loss. It also showed that low LRs lead to slow progress but more close fit to training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was shown that a LR scheduler can balance these properties and lead to quick learning with more fine grained accuracy in later stages of training. However, this did not translate to significant benefits in validation and test performance, although there was some.\n",
        "\n",
        "Experiment two demonstrated the regularisation effect of dropout both in regular trianing and in a trasnfer learning scenario. It was shown to have a signficant impact on the generalisation gap reducing it as the rate increased and reducing the validation loss signifcantly. It was also found to have a profound regularising effect in the transfer learning example. Although it did lead to improvements in performance this were fairly small. \n",
        "\n",
        "Experiment 3 demonstrated clearly the powerful impact of batch normalisation on the propogation of gradient backwards through they layers of a neural network. The stark contract in average gradients arriving in the early layers in the intial impacts was striking. The impact it had on model performance however was perhaps a bit dissapointing, but I believe can be understood.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results in experiments one and two are very much to be expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning rates are known to have a significant impact on the training dynamics and convergence of neural networks. High LRs can lead to overshooting the optimal solution and oscillations around the minimum, while low LRs result in slow convergence but more stable updates. The use of LR schedulers, such as reducing the LR over time, allows for faster initial convergence while fine-tuning the model in later stages. This is consistent with the observations in experiment one. \n",
        "\n",
        "The regularization effect of dropout is also well-established. Dropout introduces noise and stochasticity into the network by randomly dropping activation, preventing over-reliance on individual neurons and promoting more robust representations. This leads to improved generalization and reduced overfitting, as demonstrated in experiment two. Experiment 2 also demonstrates the impact that this can have on a networks ability to fit to data - with a reduced performance on the training data going along with the increased accuracy. \n",
        "\n",
        "The results of experiment three, however, were less expected. Although the gradient flow analysis clearly showed the powerful effect of batch normalization on the propagation of gradients backward through the layers of the neural network, the batch-normalized model performed quite poorly on unseen data, with the generalisation performance on the test set being really quite poor. \n",
        "\n",
        "This result is was surprising as one of the benefits of batch normalization has been shown to be its regularization effect [1], [6] and I was expecting it to *reduce* overfitting, but it did not. However, my understanding is that one of the headline benefits of batch normalisation it how it can speed up learning due to this early propogation of gradient to all layers (as was seen here). Given this more careful consideration needs to be given to other hyperparamaters which should compliment this drastic change. In these experiments all hyperparameters were fixed other than those being investigated.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of approaches I would explore to enhance the model. As well as experimenting to find more complimentary hyperparamaters for use with batch normalisation, I would use a more advanced optimizer such as the 'Adam' optimiser [2] which is near uniquitous and recommended for most cases as \"one of the more robust and effective optimization algorithms to use in deep learning\" [15].\n",
        "\n",
        "I would also like to experiment with skip connections which were introduced in more recent and successful architectures, most noteably resnets [4]. I would also try experimenting with augmenting the data in the dataset by trying some of the techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training data, such as random rotations, flips, crops, and color jittering. Data augmentation can help improve the model's ability to generalize by exposing it to a wider range of variations and reducing overfitting.\n",
