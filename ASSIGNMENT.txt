Intro

Through structured experimentation this assignment explores and tried to demonstrates a number of roperties of artificial Neural networks. Using the CIFAR 10 dataset and classification task and a relatively simple convolutional neural network, the effect that a number of network and paramaeter choices shall be explored. 

Looking first at varying learning rates and learning rate decay then at dropout for regularisation, transfer learning and batch normalisation, it is hoped that a number of important and essential properties shall be described and demonstrated. 

Whilst the aim of the task is not strictly to aim for best peformance, the impacy that the different tecnicques and choices make on performance shall be discussed. 

It shall be shown that.........
