You will be guided through the process of producing this report, which will provide you with experience in report writing that will be useful in any research project you might be involved in later in life.\n","\n","All of your report, including code and Markdown/text, ***must*** be written up in ***this*** notebook. This is not typical for research, but is solely for the purpose of this assignment. Please make sure you change the title of this file so that XXXXXX is replaced by your candidate number. You can use code cells to write code to implement, train, test, and analyse your NNs, as well as to generate figures to plot data and the results of your experiments. You can use Markdown/text cells to describe and discuss the modelling choices you make, the methods you use, and the experiments you conduct. So that we can mark your reports with greater consistency, please ***do not***:\n","\n","* rearrange the sequence of cells in this notebook.\n","* delete any cells, including the ones explaining what you need to do.\n","\n","If you want to add more code cells, for example to help organise the figures you want to show, then please add them directly after the code cells that have already been provided.\n","\n","Please provide verbose comments throughout your code so that it is easy for us to interpret what you are attempting to achieve with your code. Long comments are useful at the beginning of a block of code. Short comments, e.g. to explain the purpose of a new variable, or one of several steps in some analyses, are useful on every few lines of code, if not on every line. Please do not use the code cells for writing extensive sentences/paragraphs that should instead be in the Markdown/text cells."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HAAMLJvMBOnn"},"source":["# Abstract/Introduction (instructions) - 15 MARKS\n","Use the next Markdown/text cell to write a short introduction to your report.
